					Hello, I'm misomosispi! Don't mind me!
					Just learning some HTML and CSS and
					screwing around with that!
					</p>
					<p>
					I want to keep with the Neocities tradition
					by doing cute, small blog-style posts like
					shrines, portfolios, and stuff like that!
					</p>
					<p>
					And I really wanna improve styling...
